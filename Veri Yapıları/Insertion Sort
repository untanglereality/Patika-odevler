[22, 27, 16, 2, 18, 6] -> Insertion Sort

1) Steps
[22, 27, 16, 2, 18 ,6]
[16, 22, 27, 2, 18, 6]
[2, 16, 22, 27, 18, 6]
[2, 16, 18, 22, 27 ,6]
[2, 6, 16, 18, 22, 27]

2) Big O -> O(n^2)

3) Time complexity in general
Best case -> O(n)
Average case -> O(n^2)
Worst case -> O(n^2)

4) Time complexity for 18 after the list is sorted: 
It's in the middle of the list, thus average case.
